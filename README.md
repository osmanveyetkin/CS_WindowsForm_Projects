# Windows Forms Project – Visual Programming Course

This repository contains 4 practical Windows Forms applications developed as part of a Visual Programming course project. Each application is designed as a separate form (Form2 to Form5) and is accessible via buttons on the main form (Form1).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C#
- Windows Forms (.NET Framework 4.7.2)
- Visual Studio
